    "# Introduction\n",
    "SPAM filtering is a commonplace task for most email applications. For the user it saves time and clutter, and mitigates the risk of harm. SPAM emails may contain viruses, phishing schemes, and other embarassing content that is not safe for work. This an especially important task in an age where hacking and information security are large concerns for companies and individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some applications like Microsoft Outlook or Google Mail let the user define SPAM emails to look out for. \"Mail filters have varying degrees of configurability. Sometimes they make decisions based on matching a regular expression. Other times, code may match keywords in the message body, or perhaps the email address of the sender of the message...Some more advanced filters, particularly anti-spam filters, use statistical document classification techniques such as the naive Bayes classifier.\" [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_filtering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_filtering)\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this project is to demonstrate classification of SPAM in a repository of emails using NLP techniques and toolkits. It will include an exploration of emails and multiple experiments that compare feature sets to determine which combination makes for the best SPAM detection application. Each experiment will rely on pre-processing, feature engineering and classification modeling specific to the scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to this report, a Python program file \"classifySPAM.py\" includes the relevant processing steps to reproduce results and is packaged together as part of the deliverable. Special acknowledgement goes to the main instructor Nancy McCraken in providing baseline code for \"classifySPAM.py\" and data."
